            <h3>Consulting with health provider about vaccination</h3>
            <p>It will take several weeks for the vaccine to become fully effective after you
                receive it. Do not wait for cases of COVID-19 to spike before getting vaccinated. You will
                be better protected if you get vaccinated in advance of the next wave of infections. If you have already been vaccinated, keep track of how long it has been since
                you completed the primary vaccination dose. If it has been five or more months
                since you completed the primary vaccination dose, consider consulting with your
                health care provider about receiveing a booster shot.</p>

            <h3>Limiting activities to reduce risk of exposure</h3>
            <p>Maintain a safe distance from other people. You are more prone to exposure of COVID-19 when you are breathing the same air nearby as someone who is
                infected with COVID-19. If by any chance you need prescriptions filled, consider using a
                mail-order pharmacy to have your medications shipped to your home.</p>

Create an emergency response plan that you can reply on in case you or a close one is diagnosed with COVID-19. </p>

            <h3>Treatments</h3>
