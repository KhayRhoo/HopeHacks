            <h3>Consulting with health provider about vaccination</h3>
            <p>It will take several weeks for the vaccine to become fully active after you
                receive it. Do not wait for cases of COVID-19 to spike before getting vaccinated. You will
                be better protected if you get vaccinated in advance of the next wave of infections. If you have already been vaccinated, keep track of how long it has been since
                you completed the primary vaccination series. If it has been five or more months
                since you completed the primary vaccination series, consider consulting with your
                health care provider about getting a booster shot.</p>

            <h3>Limiting activities to reduce risk of exposure</h3>
            <p>Maintain a safe distance from other people. You are the greatest risk of being
                exposed to COVID-19 when you are breathing the same air as someone who is
                infected with COVID-19.
                â€¢ If you are seeking routine medical care, consider using telehealth to consult
                with your health care provider. If you need prescriptions filled, consider using a
                mail-order pharmacy to have your medications shipped to your home.</p>

            <h3>Treatments</h3>
            <p>Currently, there is no cure for COVID-19. However, some strategies may be employed to reduce disease severity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend staying home, drinking plenty of fluids, and isolating yourself away from other people in your home to prevent spreading the coronavirus to them.</p>
